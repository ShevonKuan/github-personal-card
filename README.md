- **GitHub Readme Stats**: Created by anuraghazra, this project provides a set of utility functions to generate GitHub readme stats. We have incorporated some of these utility functions directly into our codebase. [MIT License](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/blob/master/LICENSE)

We are grateful to the authors of these projects for their contributions to the open-source community. If you find these projects helpful, please consider starringðŸŒŸ their repositories!

### On Vercel

Since the GitHub API only allows 5k requests per hour, my `https://github-personal-card.vercel.app/card` could possibly hit the rate limiter. If you host it on your own Vercel server, then you do not have to worry about anything. Click on the deploy button to get started!

> [!NOTE]\
> If you are on the [Pro (i.e. paid)](https://vercel.com/pricing) Vercel plan, the [maxDuration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/project-configuration#value-definition) value found in the [vercel.json](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/blob/master/vercel.json) can be increased when your Vercel instance frequently times out during the card request. You are advised to keep this value lower than `30` seconds to prevent high memory usage.
